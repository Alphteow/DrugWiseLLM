Basic Understanding of DDIs:
"What are drug-drug interactions, and why are they clinically significant?"
"Explain the role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in drug-drug interactions."

Specific Drug Interactions:
"What are the potential interactions between warfarin and cannabis?"
"How does the co-administration of colchicine and clarithromycin affect patient safety?"

Mechanisms of Interaction:
"Describe how P-glycoprotein influences drug-drug interactions."
"What is the role of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of drugs, and how can its inhibition lead to interactions?"

Clinical Scenarios:
"A patient is taking both digoxin and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. What are the potential risks?"
"How should a clinician manage a patient on antiretroviral therapy who is prescribed psychotropic medications?"

Evaluation of Risk Factors:
"What factors increase the likelihood of clinically significant drug-drug interactions in elderly patients?"
"How does polypharmacy contribute to the risk of adverse drug interactions?"


Advanced Prompts
Case-Based Questions:
"A 65-year-old patient on amiodarone is prescribed simvastatin. What precautions should be taken to avoid adverse interactions?"
"Describe the potential interactions and management strategies for a breast cancer patient on CDK4/6 inhibitors and antidepressants."

Predictive and Computational Approaches:
"How can machine learning models be used to predict drug-drug interactions?"
"Explain the use of graph-based methods in identifying potential DDIs."

Special Populations:
"What are the challenges of managing drug-drug interactions in pediatric patients?"
"Discuss the implications of DDIs in patients with HIV and cancer."

Emerging Topics:
"What are the potential drug-drug interactions associated with cannabidiol (CBD) use?"

Synthesis and Explanation:
"Explain the clinical significance of drug-drug interactions in patients with polypharmacy."
"Summarize the mechanisms by which antiepileptic drugs like brivaracetam avoid significant DDIs."

Actionable Recommendations:
"What steps should be taken to minimize the risk of DDIs in patients on multiple medications?"
"Provide guidelines for managing DDIs in patients taking direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C."

Handling Ambiguity:
"What are the potential interactions between a new drug metabolized by CYP3A4 and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor?"
"How should a clinician approach a suspected DDI when the mechanism is unclear?"

Critical Analysis:
"Critique the methodology used in studies predicting DDIs using computational models."
"Evaluate the effectiveness of current tools for detecting DDIs in clinical practice."
